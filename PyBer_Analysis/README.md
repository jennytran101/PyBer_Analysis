# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:

# The purpose:  
Create the charts to show the relationship between the type of cities, drivers and riders. This analysis will help Pyber company to  imporve access and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

# Results:

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. 

Based on the graph "Total Fare by City Type", we can see that Urabn city has the highest number of fares but it decreasing. The suburban cities are the potential cities, which has the number of fares are increasing. With the rural cities, number of fare is not changing a lot and they might be decreasing.
The more total rides and drivers that the city has, the less average fare per ride and average fare per drivers. With the Rural cities, the number of total rides is more than the number of total drivers, it leads to the cost of average per drivers is high and it is higher 3 times than the Urban cities and 1.4 times than Suburban cities. Therefore, we can see that the Rural cities have demand in share- riding but the drivers is not enough to support the demand. It is same with Suburban cities. The reason why Rural and Suburban cities has low deman on share riding because, these 2 cities are out of the city so transportation is not the big problem with them there. Citizens in these cities can travel by themselves and by their own vehicles with is different with the Urban. In Urban cities, transportation is the big problem because it will take more time for the drivers to find parking or traffic time is hard. Therefore, they choose ride sharing to save money and save time.

# Summary:

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. 

Based on the data table, we can have a short conclusion for the CEO that the demand of using ride-sharing app in Urban cities is higher than Rural and Suburban citites. That is why Urban cities have more driver and the average fare per ride as well as per drivers are cheaper than the 2 others cities. The PyBer company should focus more on Suburban city especially Rural cities to bring more chance to these 2 cities to have cheaper price on fares.
